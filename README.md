## Short description

The project is a simple bookshop with a catalog page, where the user can see a list of books, add them to the shopping bag and order these books. You can see the catalog page [here](https://ekaterinamash.github.io/book-shop/pages/book-shop/book-shop.html). After adding books to the bag, the user can click the order button, which will open the order page. The order page is a separate page with a form, where the user enters information about him to order delivery of chosen books. Here is a link to the order page.
